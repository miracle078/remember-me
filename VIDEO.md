## What's in the Video

55 million people with dementia face an impossible choice: Lose independence to constant surveillance, or struggle alone. Research shows surveillance technology infringes on independence and dignity. Care partners want safety, but patients feel stripped of autonomy. There has to be a better way.

Introducing Remember Me — a privacy-first AI companion that helps people with dementia recognize loved ones and preserve memories, with complete dignity. Take a photo and ask "Who is this?" Get instant recognition: "This is Sarah, your daughter." Chat with our AI for patient, empathetic assistance. All processing happens on your device — zero cloud uploads.

Powered by Cactus SDK running entirely on-device. Face recognition, AI conversation, memory storage — all without sending a single byte to the cloud.

**Using AI memory to help people who've lost theirs.**

Remember Me: Where independence meets dignity.
