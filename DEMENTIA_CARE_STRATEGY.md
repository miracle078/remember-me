## The Perfect Edge AI Use Case - Research-Based Strategy

**Last Updated**: November 26, 2025
**Research Sources**: 30+ peer-reviewed studies and market reports

---

## 🎯 WHY THIS IS THE WINNING IDEA

### The Perfect Storm of Need

**The Crisis:**
- **$203 billion → $1.2 trillion** by 2050 in US dementia care costs ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6128069/))
- **North America dominated** elder care assistive tech market with 39.91% revenue share in 2024 ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/elder-care-assistive-robots-market-report))
- Current apps have **little focus on privacy and security** ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10603562/))
- **Surveillance tech** infringes on independence and dignity ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2025.1643238/full))

**The Irony (Perfect for Pitch):**
> "People with dementia lose their memories. But surveillance technology also steals their dignity by sending intimate moments to the cloud. We're using AI memory to help people who've lost theirs—while preserving their privacy."

---

## 🌵 THE NAME: "Remember Me"

### Primary Name Option: **"Remember Me"**

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ **Emotional**: Simple, powerful, universal plea
- ✅ **Clear Purpose**: Immediately understand what it does
- ✅ **Dignified**: Respects patients, not cutesy
- ✅ **Memorable**: Easy to say, easy to remember (ironic given use case)
- ✅ **Privacy Angle**: "Remember me, not my data"

**Tagline**: "Your memories, your device, your dignity"

### Alternative: Keep "Do Not Hug a Cactus"

**Adapted Metaphor:**
> "Just like you wouldn't hug a cactus, you shouldn't send your most precious memories—and your most vulnerable moments—to the cloud."

**Could work as**: "Do Not Hug a Cactus: Remember Me Edition"

---

## 🏆 WHY THIS DESTROYS THE COMPETITION

### 1. **Memory is LITERALLY the Problem** (Track 1 Perfect Fit!)

The hackathon track is "Memory Master" → You're building AI memory for people who've lost theirs. This is **poetic perfection**.

### 2. **Privacy/Dignity Crisis is Well-Documented**

From research:
- "Balancing constant monitoring with patients' rights to privacy and dignity is a delicate task" ([JMIR Aging](https://aging.jmir.org/2025/1/e69175))
- "Smart home technologies bring ethical concerns, particularly erosion of privacy and dignity" ([Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/digital-health/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2025.1643238/full))
- "Surveillance devices infringe on independence and feel stigmatizing" ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8040150/))
- "Care partners want monitoring, but patients report it infringes on independence" ([Wiley](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14192))

### 3. **Current Solutions Have Major Gaps**

- "Few apps provided information on expert review (20%) or content selection (11%)" ([JMIR](https://www.jmir.org/2023/1/e46188))
- "Gaps in data privacy and security standards must be addressed" ([JMIR mHealth](https://mhealth.jmir.org/2024/1/e50186))
- "Financial costs, complexity, privacy concerns are major disadvantages" ([Wiley](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.14192))

### 4. **Massive, Growing Market**

- Elder care assistive robots market growing significantly ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/elder-care-assistive-robots-market-report))
- Dementia care costs exploding: $203B → $1.2 trillion by 2050
- **55+ million people** worldwide living with dementia (2024)

### 5. **Emotional Impact is Off the Charts**

Judges will cry. Helping someone with dementia recognize their own grandchildren and maintain dignity is infinitely more powerful than any other use case.

---

## 🎬 DEMO SCRIPT (2 Minutes)

### **0:00-0:20 - Hook (The Crisis)**

```
"55 million people worldwide live with dementia. Current technology
offers two bad choices: lose independence to constant surveillance,
or struggle alone without support.

Surveillance tech sends intimate moments to the cloud, violating
dignity. Care partners want safety, but patients feel stripped of
independence."
```

### **0:20-0:40 - The Solution**

```
"Remember Me is an AI companion that helps people with dementia
maintain independence—without surveillance.

It runs 100% on their device using the Cactus SDK. Their photos,
voices, memories—they never leave the phone. Privacy AND safety."
```

### **0:40-1:30 - Live Demo**

**Show:**
1. **Photo Recognition**
   - Open photo library
   - Take photo of someone
   - App identifies: "This is Sarah, your daughter. She lives in Seattle."

2. **Memory Search**
   - Ask: "Who is Sarah?"
   - AI responds with context from past entries and photos

3. **Voice Journal**
   - Record: "Had lunch with Michael today"
   - Show searchable transcript
   - Ask: "What did I do today?"

4. **Smart Reminder**
   - Show: "It's 2pm, time for your afternoon medication"

5. **Privacy Dashboard**
   - Show: "0 MB uploaded to cloud. 100% local processing."

### **1:30-1:50 - The Technology**

```
"Powered by Qwen3 for conversation and memory, Liquid for face
recognition, all running locally using the Cactus SDK.

The irony: We're using AI memory to help people who've lost theirs.
And we're doing it without stealing their dignity by sending data
to the cloud."
```

### **1:50-2:00 - The Impact**

```
"Because dementia patients deserve independence, dignity, and
privacy—not surveillance disguised as care.

Remember Me: Your memories, your device, your dignity."
```

## 🎯 JUDGE Q&A PREP

### **Q: Why not use cloud AI for better quality?**

**A**: "Dementia patients are extremely vulnerable. Research shows surveillance tech 'infringes on independence and feels stigmatizing.' Cloud-based monitoring violates the dignity we're trying to preserve. Edge AI isn't just better—it's the only ethical choice."

### **Q: How does this relate to the Memory Master track?**

**A**: "It's perfect. The track is about AI memory helping people remember things. We're literally using AI memory to help people who've lost theirs. That's not just technical—it's poetic. Memory helping memory."

### **Q: What about caregivers who need to monitor safety?**

**A**: "Patient consent is key. They control what's shared. The app can send alerts for safety concerns, but only with explicit permission. It's transparent: 'This is what your caregiver can see.' That respects autonomy while enabling safety."

### **Q: How scalable is this?**

**A**: "55 million people with dementia worldwide. Market growing from $203B to $1.2T by 2050. Current apps have terrible privacy. We're first-to-market with privacy-first dementia care. Huge opportunity."

### **Q: Business model?**

**A**: "Freemium. Basic features free (photo memory, reminders). Premium ($15/month): advanced AI companion, caregiver dashboard, unlimited voice journaling. B2B: Sell to assisted living facilities, elder care agencies. Privacy is the moat—once breached, trust is gone forever."

### **Q: What about patients who can't use smartphones?**

**A**: "We're targeting early-to-mid stage dementia where patients can still use phones. That's actually the most valuable time—when they can maintain independence longest. For late-stage, caregivers can use the app to log information and share with patient."
